/**
 * This module provides an implementation of a subset of the W3C [Web Performance APIs](https://w3c.github.io/perf-timing-primer/) as well as additional APIs for
 * Node.js-specific performance measurements.

 *
 * * [High Resolution Time](https://www.w3.org/TR/hr-time-2)
 * * [Performance Timeline](https://w3c.github.io/performance-timeline/)
 * * [User Timing](https://www.w3.org/TR/user-timing/)
