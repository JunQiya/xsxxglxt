 * a manner that is similar, but not identical, to [`popen(3)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/popen.3.html). This capability
 * is primarily provided by the {@link spawn} function:
 *
 * ```js

 * const { spawn } = require('child_process');

 *
 * ls.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
 *   console.log(`stdout: ${data}`);

 * });
 *
 * ls.on('close', (code) => {
 *   console.log(`child process exited with code ${code}`);
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * By default, pipes for `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` are established between
 * the parent Node.js process and the spawned subprocess. These pipes have
 * limited (and platform-specific) capacity. If the subprocess writes to
 * stdout in excess of that limit without the output being captured, the
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
 * subprocess blocks, waiting for the pipe buffer to accept more data. This is
 * identical to the behavior of pipes in the shell. Use the `{ stdio: 'ignore' }` option if the output will not be consumed.

 * The command lookup is performed using the `options.env.PATH` environment
 * variable if `env` is in the `options` object. Otherwise, `process.env.PATH` is
 * used. If `options.env` is set without `PATH`, lookup on Unix is performed
 * on a default search path search of `/usr/bin:/bin` (see your operating system's
 * manual for execvpe/execvp), on Windows the current processes environment
 * variable `PATH` is used.
 *
 * On Windows, environment variables are case-insensitive. Node.js
 * lexicographically sorts the `env` keys and uses the first one that
 * case-insensitively matches. Only first (in lexicographic order) entry will be
 * passed to the subprocess. This might lead to issues on Windows when passing

 * The {@link spawn} method spawns the child process asynchronously,
 * without blocking the Node.js event loop. The {@link spawnSync} function provides equivalent functionality in a synchronous manner that blocks
 * the event loop until the spawned process either exits or is terminated.

 *
 * * {@link exec}: spawns a shell and runs a command within that
 * shell, passing the `stdout` and `stderr` to a callback function when
 * complete.
 * * {@link execFile}: similar to {@link exec} except
 * that it spawns the command directly without first spawning a shell by
 * default.
 * * {@link fork}: spawns a new Node.js process and invokes a
 * specified module with an IPC communication channel established that allows
 * sending messages between parent and child.
 * * {@link execSync}: a synchronous version of {@link exec} that will block the Node.js event loop.
 * * {@link execFileSync}: a synchronous version of {@link execFile} that will block the Node.js event loop.
 *
 * For certain use cases, such as automating shell scripts, the `synchronous counterparts` may be more convenient. In many cases, however,
 * the synchronous methods can have significant impact on performance due to
 * stalling the event loop while spawned processes complete.

         * When an IPC channel has been established between the parent and child (

         * The `sendHandle` argument can be used, for instance, to pass the handle of
         * a TCP server object to the child process as illustrated in the example below:
         *
         * ```js
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
         * import { createServer } from 'node:net';
         * import { fork } from 'node:child_process';

         *
         * // Open up the server object and send the handle.
         * const server = createServer();

         * const subprocess = require('child_process').fork('subprocess.js');

         * const server = require('node:net').createServer();
>>>>>>> parent of 99ae58fb (修正代码，并打包成功上传部署到服务器（测试IP地址）)
         * server.on('connection', (socket) => {
         *   socket.end('handled by parent');
         * });
         * server.listen(1337, () => {
         *   subprocess.send('server', server);
         * });
         * ```
         *
         * The child would then receive the server object as:
         *
         * ```js
         * process.on('message', (m, server) => {
         *   if (m === 'server') {
         *     server.on('connection', (socket) => {
         *       socket.end('handled by child');
         *     });
         *   }
         * });
         * ```
         *
         * Once the server is now shared between the parent and child, some connections
         * can be handled by the parent and some by the child.

         * server.listen(1337);
         * ```
         *
         * The `subprocess.js` would receive the socket handle as the second argument
         * passed to the event callback function:
         *
         * ```js
         * process.on('message', (m, socket) => {
         *   if (m === 'socket') {

         *       // Check that the client socket exists.
         *       // It is possible for the socket to be closed between the time it is
         *       // sent and the time it is received in the child process.

         *   }

         * Do not use `.maxConnections` on a socket that has been passed to a subprocess.
         * The parent cannot track when the socket is destroyed.

         * Any `'message'` handlers in the subprocess should verify that `socket` exists,
